        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
        
        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

    <h2>Python Programming</h2>
    <p><font color>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
